Prof. Yang is an Assistant Professor in School of Computer Science and Technology / Faculty of Innovation Engineering at Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST). Before he joined MUST, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Sun Yat-sen University (2021.12-2023.06). He obtained his doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics, Korea University, 2021 under the guidance of Prof. Junseok Kim. His research interests are Computational Multi-phase Fluid Dynamics, Phase-field Method, Numerical Simulations in Science and Engineering, and Mathematical Modeling .  He has published 55 SCI papers as first or corresponding author from 2018.  
已主持科研項目如下：

國家自然科學基金青年科學基金項目；

博士後科學基金面上項目。

博士期間被中國駐韓大使館教育處評為2020年度優秀在韓國家公派留學人員；入選2022年度博士後國際交流計劃引進項目。

Introduction of PF_CFD Lab
======
PF_CFD Lab (相場_計算流體動力學 課題組) aims to develop high-performance mathematical models and computational algorithms in science and engineering. As a leader of my lab, I have published more than 70 SCI papers from 2018 and accumulated related experiences and skills in the fileds of phase-field method and incompressible fluid simulations. Moreover, I am also interested in immersed boundary method, level-set method, lattice Boltzmann method, image processing, 3D volume reconstruction, and digital twins. 

In my homepage, I provide several simple but practical MATLAB codes for interested readers or students. These codes can be used to simulate phase-field Cahn-Hilliard dynamics, Fluid flows, square phase-field crystal dynamics, dendritic growth, Natural convection, and Image segmentation, etc. I will update other open source codes in the future. In the Publications, I only provide the papers as first or corresponding author. For more details of my publications, please refer to my [ResearchGate page](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Junxiang-Yang-2). Some interesting simulation results are pasted in Portfolio. 

Research topics in my Lab
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section


Open positions / 招生信息
======
Master degree in Applied Mathematics openings on computational physics (fluids, biology, and materials) and numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). Undergraduate students should contact Prof. Yang and apply to School of Computer Science and Engineering at Macau University of Science and Technology. 

For the students who want to study numerical simulations with me, the prerequisites are: Calculus (Advanced Mathematics), Linear Algebra, and College Physics.  Mastering C program, MATLAB,  Latex  and passing a numerical analysis course are recommended. 

Recently, I have prepared more than 40 research topics, 欢迎數學、力學、物理、計算機和機械工程類專業的本科同學報考碩士課程！招生長期有效！若有意向，請提前通過郵件 jxyang@must.edu.mo 聯繫我，謝謝關注！

Note: 水利數字孿生將作為本課題組未來的研究方向之一，歡迎水利工程、土木工程和海洋工程等專業的同學報考！
