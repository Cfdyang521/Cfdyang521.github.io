Prof. Yang is an Assistant Professor in School of Computer Science and Technology / Faculty of Innovation Engineering at Macau University of Science and Technology (MUST). Before he joined MUST, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Sun Yat-sen University (2021.12-2023.06). He obtained his doctoral degree in Applied Mathematics, Korea University, 2021 under the guidance of Prof. Junseok Kim. His research interests are Computational Multi-phase Fluid Dynamics, Phase-field Method, Numerical Simulations in Science and Engineering, and Mathematical Modeling .  He has published 55 SCI papers as first or corresponding author from 2018.

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, academicpages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

Open positions / 招生信息
------
Master degree in Applied Mathematics openings on computational physics (fluids, biology, and materials) and numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs). Undergraduate students should contact Prof. Yang and apply to School of Computer Science and Engineering at Macau University of Science and Technology. 

For the students who want to study numerical simulations with me, the prerequisites are: Calculus (Advanced Mathematics), Linear Algebra, and College Physics.  Mastering C program, MATLAB,  Latex  and passing a numerical analysis course are recommended. 

Recently, I have prepared more than 40 research topics, 欢迎數學、力學、物理、計算機和機械工程類專業的本科同學報考碩士課程！若有意向，請提前通過郵件 jxyang@must.edu.mo 聯繫我，謝謝關注！

Note: 水利數字孿生將作為本課題組未來的研究方向之一，歡迎水利工程、土木工程和海洋工程等專業的同學報考！
