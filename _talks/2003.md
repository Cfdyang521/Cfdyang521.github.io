//Introduction: The first-order accurate pressure projection method is used to update solutions. The intermediate velocities are obtained by an explicit Euler scheme. The pressure Poisson equation is iteratively solved with a linear Multigrid algorithm.
The advection term in NS equations is approximated with a first-order upwing scheme and the viscosity term is approximated with a five-point central difference scheme. 
The IBM force model in " An Immersed Boundary Method with Formal Second-Order Accuracy and Reduced Numerical Viscosity " is adopted. 

The C codes are as follows:

The MATLAB codes for posttreatment are as follows:
